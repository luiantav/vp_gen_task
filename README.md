# Generalisation task "Spacebloom"

This repo contains the code for all three sessions of the "Spacebloom" task. To run the task:

1. clone to a server of choice.
2. Next, create a folder for data saving. Change the path in handle_data.php and handle_param.php to the path of your output folder on the server. These two files handle data saving and saving of parameters to be reused in the next sessions respectively. Make sure you give the output folder read and write permissions. 
3. Run the task in a browser (avoid Firefox) by adapting the url below to your path. To run sessions 2 or 3, change the url to spacebloom2 or spacebloom3 respectively.
